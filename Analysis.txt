Unscramble Computer Science Problems Run Time Analysis

Task0.py Runs in O(1), being only a look-up independent of the data size.

Task1.py Runs in O(n), as it runs through the text and call data a single time.

Task2.py Runs in O(n), as it builds a dictionary and then finds the largest item

Task3.py Runs in O(nlogn), as it runs through call data a single time, but uses a Python internal sort function.  

Task4.py Runs in O(nlogn), as it runs through the text call data a single time, the call data twice, but uses a Python internal sort function.
